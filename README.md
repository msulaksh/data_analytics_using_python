# data_analytics_using_python

Using widely known IRIS dataset for kick starting my path into Data Analytics.

Starting with scikit-learn, i`ll demonstrate multiple functions and methods over data.
All this is part of my Self-learning timeline.

After working out with Python, MongoDb and other Haoop related technologies, I will now be learning stuff related to various techniques and python libraries used for getting useful insights out of data.


Thanks
